# About Me

I've had an exciting, interesting and fun career. I started out working in CAD, transitioned to desktop publishing apps, did some time on game projects and even had a brief exposure to a big data application. All my experiences with each company has been amazing. I've had the opportunity to work with a lot of talented and brilliant people, many of whom I feel lucky to still call friends.

I'm now trying to morph once again from being basically a desktop application developer into a mobile application developer; specifically iOS and Swift. When my project at Alteryx ended I decided it was time to make a break and do something new. I immersed myself in learning Swift and iOS app development. Transitioning into a new tech domain space isn't always easy, So when a contract position was presented to me to work on an investigative project at Medtronic developing iOS apps for monitoring Bluetooth LE patient sensor devices I jumped at the opportunity.

The Medtronic contract has been an outstanding experience. I've been able to explore and gain experience with Android OS, iOS, Java, Android Studio, Xamarin, Xcode, Bluetooth LE, RESTful API, XSLT, TCP, iTunes Connect, and a number of other technologies.

## Life Is A Journey

I know it's a cliche, especially as an answer to an interview question, but I've always like the phrase _"Life is a journey, not a destination."_ My career definitely has been and continues to be a journey.
