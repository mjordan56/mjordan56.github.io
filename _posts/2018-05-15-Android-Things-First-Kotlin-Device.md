# Synopsis

[Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html){:target="_blank"} is a version of the Android OS targeted at the Internet of Things (IoT) market. With Android Things developers can build connected devices for a wide variety of consumer, retail, and industrial applications.

# Overview

The new Android Things OS is (IMHO) really cool. With the rise in Internet of Things (IoT) devices I think this is going to be an interesting technology to watch. Currently, most IoT devices seem to be using C or Python code running on Linux OS to create application solutions. While I think these solutions are moderately interesting I find the entry of the Android OS combined with the tools and support infrastructure Google has build for Android developers really interesting.

The Android Things OS strips out a number of the Android OS components that aren't required or make sense for an IoT device. But it also makes a number of the really cool features and tools from Android and Google available to IoT devices. This is __huge__! The potential for interesting new devices is mind-boggling.

I read through the [Android Things SDK](https://developer.android.com/things/sdk/index.html){:target="_blank"} preview documentation and created my "first device". The following link details my experience implementing the first device Android Things project.

This was an interesting little project, the equivalent of a "Hello World" project for Android Things.
