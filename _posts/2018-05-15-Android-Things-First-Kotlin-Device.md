# Synopsis

Re-do the [Android Things First Device](http://shinyobjectaffliction.com/AndroidIoTFirstDevice){:target="_blank"} project using Kotlin as the development language.

# Overview

Android Things is now out of developer pre-release status with the release of version 1.0 at the Google I/O 2018 conference. Over the last year since I did my Android Things IoT first device project Kotlin has taken the Android world by storm. From what I've seen I really like this new language. There are many similarities to Swift and other contemporary languages. This is a nice improvement for Android development over Java.

In this project I'm re-implementing the Android Things IoT first device project using Kotlin. I'm also looking at all the cool changes and additions to the Android Things development environment such as the Android Things Console.

Information about this project, including source code, is available at [Android Things First Kotling Device](http://shinyobjectaffliction.com/AndroidIoTFirstKotlinDevice){:target="_blank"}.
